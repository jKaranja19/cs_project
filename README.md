## Introduction

Farm Connect is a web application system that utilizes blockchain technology to enable real-time tracking and location monitoring of agricultural products from farms to their respective destinations.

## Built With

The following system has been built using the following:
- [Laravel 10](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation)
- [spatie/laravel-permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission)
- [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/starter-kits#breeze-and-blade)

## How it works
Once the user is registered within the system, they can input their product details and make an order for their transportation. Once loaded, the user will be prompted to make a payment before the product has been transported. Afterwards, the vehicle assigned to transport the goods is tracked using the system. After arriving at the destination, a confirmation message is sent to the user and the status of the product is updated to ‘arrived’.

## Installation Process

<code>git clone github.com/jKaranja19/farmconnect </code>
