# Farmconnect

I've tried to do this part, but, I'm having an error because i do not have the files you used to create all the things in this specific branch.
So it probably works only on your side, but not on mine.

## The Error

- PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Failed opening required 'C:\farm_connect_rv\farmconnect/vendor/autoload.php' (include_path='C:\xampp\php\PEAR') in C:\farm_connect_rv\farmconnect\artisan:18

That is the error I'm having, ao i can't integrate this cod eon my side.
